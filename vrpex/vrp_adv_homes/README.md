# vrp_adv_homes
## vRPex only

This script is not easy to be configured, please pay atention to the cfg file and read every commentary on it.  

This replaces the basic_homes from vRP. It's about the same code but modified to accept multiple homes and future improvements.  

Since this replaces the vRP homes comment your cfg.homes list in vRP.
